Our lab develops data science techniques for brain mapping in health and disease. We are interested in modelling complex, high dimensional, network dynamics of brain structure and function using neuroimaging. We use our models to integrate empirical data from multiple modalities (e.g., fMRI and diffusion MRI) to investigate basic disease mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer disease and Frontotemporal Dementia) and psychiatric disorders (e.g., Schizophrenia and Autism).

Before establishing this lab at Monash, Adeel worked as Senior Research Associate, from 2012 – 2018, at Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging ("The FIL") of UCL where he was supervised by Karl Friston and Geraint Rees to develop brain connectivity (generative) models using functional neuroimaging. He also worked in close collaboration with Sarah Tabrizi and Jason Warren to investigate pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. These collaborations are now continuing with his appointment as an "Honorary" Senior Research Associate at UCL.
